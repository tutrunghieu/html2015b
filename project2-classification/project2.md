# Course project 2, image classification

You are given the images inside the zip file mit8-images-64x64.zip which contains 2688 images in 8 categories. The same dataset as in project 1.

In this project you have to design a classifier to give each image some tags or categories.

Please complete the project and write the report by answering the following questions.

### Q1. Load the feature table.

Please load the image into a table. The last column of the table will be the category of the image (coast, forest, mountain, country, inside city, tall building, street, highway). Other columns will be the feature vector.

Please report the number of columns and number of rows of your table.

Please explain why you choose the feature table.

### Q2. Design a classifier to give a tag for each image. 

You can choose one of the classification method you have learned (svm, boosting, bagging, random forest, logistic regression).

Report the error on your training set.

### Q3. Produce the output 

You have to select 30% of 2688 images in the dataset as the testing set. Then you write the code to produce HTML tags for each image.
